# Node.js-Projects-Collection
Project Name: Node.js Login System with Activity Logging

This repository contains a Node.js project that demonstrates how to create a login page and log user activity with timestamps. Upon user login, the system saves the username, login date, and the action to a text file. This is useful for applications requiring audit trails, user activity tracking, or security monitoring.
Features:

    User login system with basic authentication.
    Logs user details and timestamps upon login.
    Saves login information to a text file for auditing and tracking.
    Built using Node.js and Express.js.

Tech Stack:

    Node.js
    Express.js
    File handling with the fs module

This project is part of a series of small but practical applications Iâ€™m building to improve my backend development skills. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or use it as a base for your own projects.
